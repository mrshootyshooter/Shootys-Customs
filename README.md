# Shootys-Customs
Welcome to Shooty's Customs, this is a public record of my complete builds. Some builds will be public, others are previews of my completed work.
If you find an error in a file attach a new commit to it. You can also contact me on Discord via mrshootyshooter, I frequently check DMs and DM requests.
Enjoy any builds and feel free to use them in your server. I do custom builds and coding for free or a small, agreed upon, price. 
From time to time I may also add small tutorials and snips of custom builds to use in your own custom builds. 90% of builds are for console.
